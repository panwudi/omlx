"""pyannote diarize Phase 2: mono / multi-speaker diarization wrapper.

Phase 1 (omlx/engine/diarize.py) handles stereo recordings where each
channel carries one speaker. Phase 2 covers everything else — mono
recordings, conference audio, podcasts with shared microphones —
by running pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 and grafting per-word
speaker labels onto the ASR output.

Activation
----------
- Explicit:  diarize_backend='pyannote'
- Auto:      diarize_backend='auto' + mono input
             (Phase 1 stereo+L/R still wins when both are given)

Word-to-speaker attribution
---------------------------
For each ASR word with [start, end]:
  1. Compute overlap duration against every diarization turn.
  2. Pick the turn with the longest overlap. That speaker wins.
  3. If the word lies entirely outside any turn, fall back to the
     nearest turn within ``gap_tolerance`` seconds; otherwise mark
     ``speaker=None``.

This is deterministic — straddle cases resolve by overlap duration,
not by first/last-encountered, so re-running on the same audio gives
the same labels.

Speaker labelling
-----------------
- ``speakers`` given (list[str]): first-encountered pyannote label
  (SPEAKER_00) maps to speakers[0], next new label to speakers[1],
  and so on, in the order pyannote emits them. Excess raw labels fall
  back to anonymous numbering.
- ``num_speakers`` given (int): pyannote constrains to exactly N
  speakers; oMLX renames SPEAKER_xx → speaker_0/1/2/... unless
  ``speakers`` is also given.
- Neither: pyannote auto-detects between ``min_speakers`` and
  ``max_speakers`` (defaults to its pipeline defaults if not set).

Dependencies (installed at the user's site)
-------------------------------------------
- pip install pyannote.audio torch torchaudio  (~400 MB on Apple silicon)
- HuggingFace gated license at
  https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 must be accepted in the
  web UI (one-time, per HF account).
- HF_TOKEN (or HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN) must be present in the server's
  environment, or passed via the ``hf_token`` argument.

The import of pyannote.audio is deferred to first-call inside
``_get_pipeline``; importing this module is free, so the rest of the
engine stays warm even on machines that have never installed pyannote.
The loaded pipeline is cached in a module-level singleton (guarded by
a Lock for concurrent first-call safety) — the first transcription pays
the ~3-5 s load cost; subsequent calls are free.
